# Product Analytics Dashboard (End-to-End Data Analysis)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project showcases a complete data analysis workflow, starting from raw data ingestion in a relational database to the creation of an interactive business intelligence dashboard. [cite_start]The analysis focuses on sales performance, profit margins, and growth trends for a global audio technology company[cite: 1, 2].

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
* [cite_start]**Database Management:** Microsoft SQL Server [cite: 1, 2]
* [cite_start]**Data Visualization:** Power BI [cite: 1, 2]
* [cite_start]**Query Language:** T-SQL (SQL Server) [cite: 1, 2]
* [cite_start]**Core Skills:** ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), Data Modeling, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), Data Cleaning[cite: 1, 2].

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### 1. Database Setup & Data Cleaning (SQL Server)
* [cite_start]Created a dedicated SQL database to house sales, product, and discount data[cite: 1, 2].
* [cite_start]Performed data cleaning using SQL scripts to handle nulls and format inconsistencies[cite: 1, 2].
* [cite_start]Developed **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** and complex **JOINs** to transform raw data into a structured format ready for analysis[cite: 1, 2].

### 2. Data Integration & Modeling
* [cite_start]Connected **Power BI** to the **SQL Server** instance for direct data retrieval[cite: 1, 2].
* [cite_start]Engineered a star-schema data model within Power BI to optimize report performance[cite: 1, 2].

### 3. DAX Analysis
Developed advanced DAX measures to track key performance indicators (KPIs), including:
* [cite_start]**Total Revenue & Net Profit** [cite: 1, 2]
* [cite_start]**Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth Metrics** [cite: 1, 2]
* [cite_start]**Unit Sales Trends** [cite: 1, 2]
* [cite_start]**Profit Margin Analysis** across different categories [cite: 1, 2]

### 4. Interactive Dashboard Features
* [cite_start]**Image-Based Slicers:** Interactive visuals that allow users to filter data by clicking on product images[cite: 1, 2].
* [cite_start]**Dynamic Tooltips:** Custom hover-over insights providing detailed breakdowns of customer segments[cite: 1, 2].
* [cite_start]**Global Sales Map:** Geospatial analysis of revenue performance by country[cite: 1, 2].

## 📈 Key Business Insights
* [cite_start]Identified specific discount strategies that successfully drive volume without compromising long-term profitability[cite: 1, 2].
* [cite_start]Visualized seasonal sales peaks, allowing for better inventory management and marketing alignment[cite: 1, 2].

## 📂 Repository Contents
* [cite_start]`sales.pbix`: The full Power BI report file[cite: 1].
* `SQL_Queries.sql`: (Optional) The T-SQL scripts used for data transformation.
